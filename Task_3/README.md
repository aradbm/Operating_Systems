# OS3

run make, and than run for part A:
The client side: stnc -c IP PORT
or
The server side:stnc -s PORT

for Part B:
We didn't have enought time to get the client and server working seperatly so we had it in 1 function.
So, to run the server-client and get a resault, just run:
./stnc [-s PORT] [-p <type> <param>] [-q]

so when you run server, it does both client and server and calculate the time as output.

we added screen shots of the runs.
